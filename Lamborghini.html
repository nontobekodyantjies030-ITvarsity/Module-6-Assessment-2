        <p>Lamborghini engines are all naturally aspirated engines. This means that the engines don't use the force induction of turbochargers or superchargers. The oxygen intake in the engine depends completely on atmospheric pressure. It's an ingenious feat in engineering, physics, and mechanics.</p>
